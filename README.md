# Easy Effects Preset
## Linux Pipewire audio preset for HP Laptop speakers

Linux tends to do weird things with audio. On my HP ProBook it made it sound like a busted AM radio from the 1940s. This preset enhances clarity and loudness.

## How To Use
Simply download the `.json` file and import it into Easy Effects by using the preset manager.

The Limiter settings ensure you don't overload your speakers, but if audio sounds distorted via clipping you can just lower the `Input` parameter in the Limiter.
